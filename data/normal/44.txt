I waste so much time on the internet. I can say that you’ll find so much useful stuff available at your disposal but you’ll also find fun stuff that you can use to get out of boredom.

Fortunately, you can all find them on Google because, for one thing, Google is not just smart, but also fun. You can play games or even learn something useful without leaving Google. You don’t believe me? I’ll show you some.

Well, this is the last one. This is not a Google feature, but it’s a collection of features above. I use it all the time when I’m bored or when I need to kill time.

One of my favorite Google search features is the fun fact because I can learn from it, and make me want to ask more. Sometimes, I play snake, but I use the coin flip to decide which one I’ll use. :)
