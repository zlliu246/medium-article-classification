Fellow writers,

Letâ€™s cut to the chase.

Mediumâ€™s policy of having 100 followers before you earn the bucks â€” totally sucks. And unless Iâ€™m

, thereâ€™s no way theyâ€™re gonna change that.

So yes, I need your help.

I need your followâ€™s.

How I went from hating itâ€¦to actually supporting it
Look, if you want those 100 followers, youâ€™ve gotta choose:

ðŸ”´ The Lucky way : Being a talented writer with a good knowledge of medium algorithm, and with a little luck you have your first viral articles â€” despite being a beginner.

ðŸ”´ The Hard way: Write 100â€™s of articles, improve your writing, and build up an audience from the ground.

ðŸ”´ The Short way : The follow-for-follow method

P.S. If thereâ€™s any other way, donâ€™t be shy to comment.

And I chose the Short way.

Honestly, it wasnâ€™t always like this. It just felt so wrong â€” like I was cheating my way on being a writer. And it makes you wonder what kind of writer youâ€™re gonna become.

But then again , building an audience from the ground up wasnâ€™t exactly my cup of tea. Nor am I a born writer â€” I donâ€™t have any natural talent. In fact, for the very first week; I didnâ€™t publish anything â€” Writing for me was still a hobby, when in fact, I wanted to take it seriously.

How did I come around then?

Well , Iâ€™ve convinced myself that Iâ€™m doing it for getting feedbacks; That Iâ€™ll be held accountable by those 100 followers and then; then Iâ€™ll take writing seriously.

Pretty shitty reason, but it worked. Worked well enough for me to write this article, move my lazy ass, and hit that publish button.

And the fastest way to get those 100 followers?

The Follow-for-Follow method.
