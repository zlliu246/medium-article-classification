Well, well, well. The gang’s all here.

This is just a short post to say thank you for 100 followers!

I’m proud to say that I stuck to my guns, did it without the follow-for-follow method, and grew completely organically. So, it is possible! This is not to say any method is “better” than the other. How you choose to grow is completely up to you, and I hope all of us achieve the success we dream of in whatever way we deem best for us.

Anyway, I slowed down on producing content, so I certainly haven’t been posting much. As we get closer to the holiday season, I’m getting busier, working with clients, and starting my new Youtube channel (Feel free to subscribe if you’re into books. I’d appreciate your support on this new journey)! Even with all of that, I have a ton of things in my drafts that I’m getting ready to publish soon.

Overall, Thank you for coming on this journey with me, and I hope you stay for my next goal: 250 followers.
