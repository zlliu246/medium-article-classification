Hello! Just like many writers in this community, I am new here and looking to grow on this platform. If you are reading this article then you might also be a beginner struggling with gaining followers. However, if we have confidence in ourselves and encourage one another then we will be able to expand to a great extent.

Despite the fact that this “follow for a follow” approach is looked down upon, I believe that with the proper intention, it is a great way to start. This is because statistically speaking it is shown to be highly effective. It is a great way to meet other new writers and seek their work.

About Me
I am currently a student studying at The University of Alberta, in Canada, pursuing a bachelor’s degree in economics. Outside of this platform, I am not new to writing. I’ve been writing for the majority of my life and always had a passion for it. My favorite topics to write about are anything to do with finances, self-improvement, and motivation.
