Anyone needs 100 followers?

Hello there, everyone. I began writing blog posts “2 years ago” in order to share my experiences with a bigger audience. So I’ve been reading these blogs about people who need 100 followers, and it looks to be working for them, so I decided to create my own since I, too, need 100 followers.
I currently have 67 fans. However, everyone is aware of the requirement to achieve 100 followers.

Anyone reading this is likely to share the same ambition to amass 100 followers. As a consequence, I’ll make it short and sweet.

So here’s my plan…
This will almost certainly happen if we all work together to make it happen.

-Begin by leaving a comment on this article. If you’re at a loss for words, simply say, “Help me reach 100 followers, and I’ll reciprocate.”

-Please then follow me so that I may return the favor.

-Follow that with as many claps as you can to help spread the word and encourage more people to read and reply.

Finally, if someone follows you, return the favor. This post is designed to help one another, but it won’t work if you don’t reciprocate.

Thanks for Reading I really appreciate it.
