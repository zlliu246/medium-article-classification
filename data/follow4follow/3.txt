Need 100+ Followers?
It’s been five months since I am actively using Medium. Previously, I only used to read articles for information purposes. I’ve come across many stories where various writers have asked to join 100 Follower Club and grow together.

I find this initiative very interesting and confusing at the same time. When you ask people to follow you, the first thing that you should be clear about is that, what are you offering to 100 followers club? Why should people follow you? Are you sharing something with the world that has value? Once you have an answer to these questions, you have every right to do it (NOT saying that others don’t have it, but personally I will avoid it).

Follow for Follow
What is a faster way to grow?
I cannot stress this enough, work on your skills and offer something of value to people who take their time out to read your content. I have over 5 years of content writing experience, but still it is a long road for me. There are so many amazing creators here who share there tips that actually help me out. So, focus on producing content that can help others, they will come back and read it.

Follow Me for a Follow-Back
If you think my content is worth it, follow me and I will surely follow back. Clap for my content if you like it, and I’ll do the same for you. Let’s help each other grow and create content that can help others.

Hope you’ll keep producing great content without losing hope. Stay positive and don’t ever give up.
