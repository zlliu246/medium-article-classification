You Need 100 Followers and I Want to Help
I have a stupid idea and I’m hoping this works.
People have been commenting on my stories or replying to my comments on other stories with “please follow me,” lately. I want to help you guys by doing something so stupid that, on paper, it should work. We don’t live in a perfect world full of kindness, but I’ve seen some of that here. Guys, if you need 100 followers, please comment below with the @ symbol together with your Medium name. (I’ve noticed that not all people use their real names on here.)

The reason why I’m doing this is because when people comment for others to follow them and don’t leave a mention or link to their profile, some of us have to search for you on Medium. Now, I’ve had experiences when I couldn’t find people by their Medium names, so I couldn’t follow them back. So please be sure to comment a link or mention to your profile. It makes things way easier.

Also, one more thing. Please understand that by commenting that you want to be followed on this particular article, I would like for you to bestow the same kindness and courtesy that you’re requesting on others. None of us on here are the only ones who need more followers, views, reads, or subscribers. So please follow your peers. This world needs more kindness. Where better to find it than a place where aspiring writers and hobbyists build each other up? Thank you all for getting me this far. I only hope that I can do the same for you.
