So, you want to reach 100 followers on Medium? Great, I do too! And I totally believe in us! WE CAN DO IT! Me and the person reading this blog post, that is. Hi there, it’s a dream of mine to join the Medium Partner Program and earn money writing interesting content but, I need those follows! I assume you need them too if you’re reading this! So, I have a challenge. I saw a guy here on Medium called 
Arabind7
 post about the idea of a follow for follow challenge. The idea being we all have the same aspiration so why not support each other? I decided to write my own article and see if it works for me too!

Here’s how it works:

1. Follow me

2. Leave claps on my post (As many as possible. You’re allowed up to 50)

3. Leave a comment letting others know you’re participating & introduce yourself if you’d like

4. I follow you back

5. I clap for your comments

6. I go look at your posts and leave claps (I will give back equal claps for your posts so leave 50 & get 50)

7. EVERYONE WINS!

Maybe you could try too if you’d like. So don’t waste any more time… FOLLOW ME! I will follow you back and NEVER unfollow. Deal? I love to help other writers and creators reach their goals! I’m just one of those fun, supportive, positive people! We can all accomplish our goals and live our DREAMS!

Now that I’ve got your follow, I want to thank you and tell you about myself. I’m a millennial in my 30’s. I write a personal blog on WordPress that earns me a couple bucks here and there. I write and sell eBooks too, and I have a couple small YouTube Channels with one monetized at the time of me writing this article. I really love making money for myself and helping others do the same! I’m a southern gal with a big heart and lots of ambition! I hope you like my content. I work hard to give something special every time! Thanks for reading & Following! See you in the comments!
