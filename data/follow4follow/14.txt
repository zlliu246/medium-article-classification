We All Need 100 Followers

I did not want to stoop so low as to make one of those posts that beg for followers, but here we are.

Since Medium has set up the rule that you must have 100 followers to be able to monetize your content I am sure that many of you, like me, are chasing after that first 100.

That illusive, beautiful 100 that seems so close yet so far. I am currently sitting at 50 followers and I have decided to embarrass myself by writing about gaining followers hoping that we can help each other as a writing community to do just that.

I have noticed that people who participate in following trains seem to always end up being “dead-weight followers”. Meaning that they might follow you but they won’t read your content or interact with it any way. That or they simply unfollow you once they reach 100. This seems to be the trend that repeats itself under the #first100 and #followtrain tags I have seen circulating on Medium.

This will not be me. Not only will I follow you back if you follow me, but I will try and actually read and engage with your content as well (and not just to say “thanks for sharing” or some lame variation that doesn't bring any value to the comment section). I won’t be unfollowing anyone if I do manage to reach my goal of 100 followers.

Everyone knows what happens next. If you feel like it, follow, comment, interact, and clap on this post. Interact with the people in the comments and let’s get everyone that 100. I will be following everyone back, and remaining a consistent, active follower as well.

P.S: It felt just as embarrassing to write this post as one would assume. If not for anything else, leave a clap for my embarrassment.
