I created this Medium account in November of 2021. I didn’t post a single thing since then and this would be my first official post on the platform.

So, how did I get 100 followers by posting nothing by February? I saw one of those 100 follower hack guides. The author had a bunch of useful tips by I only used one of them.

I commented on the author’s post about how I am new to the platform. I pointed out I do believe writers like reading each other’s posts and following each other is no problem. Since then, I have got a couple of people following me every day and I follow back without hesitation. I also do read their posts and hit the clap button when I do.

If I had more time on my hand, I would’ve been active on Medium. I do plan to be from now on.

If I had followed every actionable advice, such as commenting on 100 follower blog posts, I would’ve definitely reached the mark within a few days. Instead, it took me two months.

However, now I have definitive proof it works. Additionally, reaching the 100 follower mark has me pumped about making me the time to write my blog posts on Medium.

Have you already reached your first 100? How long did it take?
