Apparently, We All Need 100 Followers

Hey guys, I started writing on Medium on “April 13” cause I just wanted to see my name online. I have been seeing this type of article on medium about people who need 100 followers and it definitely works for them so I decided to write mine cause I definitely need 100 followers.

Write now I have about 70 followers and I think that is pretty cool in less than one month. But we all know why we need to reach that 100 follower milestone.

I’m guessing anyone reading this is fairly like-minded in that you want to gain 100 followers. So I’m going to make it plain and simple.

Here’s the deal
When we all come together to make this happen it will surely happen.

. First, comment on this article ( If you can’t think of anything to say, then just put ‘Help me gain 100 followers and I’ll return the favor’)

. Next, follow me so I can easily follow you back as soon as possible.

. After that, clap on this article as many times as you can so this article gets out there, and more people read it, leading to your comment being viewed by more people.

. Finally, please be a good human being and follow back anyone who follows you, this article is supposed to help one another, and that doesn’t really work if you don’t return the favor.

Good luck hitting 100 followers! 🙂
