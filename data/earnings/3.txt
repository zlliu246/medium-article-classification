I’m so excited about my growth here on the platform that I can’t stop writing and this is just wonderful.

Another month came to an end and now I’m creating a habit of writing down my earnings to get a point of my earnings, views, and the like.

This was my second month of earnings here at Medium and I made more than double that in the month of June.

My next goal for August is make 100$.
