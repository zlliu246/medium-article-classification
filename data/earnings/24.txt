Spoiler: I am not writing this on the beach from my laptop

It’s been a minute since I’ve written on here. Due to a hectic work schedule, I haven't had time to myself. But surprisingly, I have still managed to earn monthly revenue from my previous articles.

I know many of you are curious so let’s dive into the stats.

The Numbers
Views equal money.

It’s as simple as that.

However, it takes quite a bit of views to make a sufficient amount nowadays.


One of my top-performing stories
These are the stats for one of my best stories.

And although it collected a whooping 1,000 views…


I’m rich!
Those views didn’t exactly translate to dollars.

This is because Medium determines earnings from not only views but the reading time as well.

Even so, the earnings per view will more than likely be below a dollar.

It’s free money though, so I’m not complaining.


Overall, I have earned about 75$ on a platform that lets writers join for free (to an extent).

It took lots of time and effort, but I’d say it was definitely worth the journey. And I hope I have been able to help others with the information I share in my articles.
