2 SIMPLE Tips —INCREASE Your Medium Earnings TODAY

It’s really very simple. In this short article I will share 2 simple tips you can use to earn more money on Medium starting today.

1. Turn Your Readers Into Members
Most of the money you will make on Medium is from Medium Members reading your stories. The easiest way to increase this number is to turn your existing followers and readers into members.

The way I do this is by simply asking my readers to become a member. And I explain to them how this is beneficial to both me and them.

2. Keep Your Readers On Medium
It’s nice for your readers to read only a single article from you. But it’s even better if they read two. Or three. Or more.

You can do this in several ways; here are some examples:

Create lists and link to them in relevant articles.
Like these:

Reference a previous article you wrote if it’s relevant to the current article you’re writing.
By doing this you keep your readers engaged with more than just a single article you wrote. This will help you earn more money.

I hoped you liked this article. Consider supporting me and other writers by signing up for a Medium membership. It only costs $5/month and I receive a small fee. And you will be able to read unlimited stories on Medium. Thank you.
