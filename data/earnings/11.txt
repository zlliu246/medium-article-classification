It’s been a rough year for all of us. That doesn’t mean we didn’t make any money. At least I tried. The medium bonuses changed the earnings for a couple of months, and I tried to profit.

Last 12 months, I’ve been writing on medium. On the 12th of August, I started sharing my articles, and they got an excellent response as well.

I wrote such an article six months ago about my earnings from August to January, and now it’s time to do the yearly breakdown.

February 2021
February this year was decent, nothing too special — it was my birthday month so that a little extra cash would be nice.

I earned a total of $318.14 which isn’t too shabby. Let’s see what the statistics tell us.

As you can tell, the views didn’t really stand out but were stable around 600 per day, which is lower than I was used to. But to be honest, I didn’t put in the hard work I should have.

March 2021 — Opposite Changes
Very strange month, at least I think so. The views went down by just a little, and the earning went up by just a bit.

I earned $330.11 this month, and these were the stats.

April 2021 — A Deception, But Then The Bonuses Came In
Okay, let’s start with the views for this month.

These stats are better than last month, but that didn’t reflect in the earnings, only $178.12.

But that’s where the fun part kicks in. Medium decided to give their 1000 best writers a $500 bonus. I got it. I was thrilled, and I didn’t know if this was real or just a mistake on their end. But in the end, I got it, and I was so happy because this was my worst month in a while.

Which set my total earnings for that month to $678.12.

May 2021 — Another Bonus?
After the dazzling surprise of last month, the whole Medium community hoped that this bonus would become a monthly thing. The whole month I put in a lot of effort to become one of the best 1000 writers again.

We see that in the stats.

That’s an additional 10.000 views compared to April, and I had an article that stood out. You can read it if you want.

This set my total earned money to $402.08, which assured me of the $500 bonus again.

This time Medium introduced a tier system that said that the best 1000 writers, based on their earnings, would receive the $500 bonus. The 1001–1500 best writers would receive the $100 bonus, and the last 500 writers would receive a $50 bonus.

This summed up my total to $902.08 for May.

June 2021 — Another Bonus & Viral Article!
As the hype around the bonuses kept growing — this month, a medium told us that they would continue to issue the bonuses until the end of July.

This month I tried to write a bit about space, and quickly an article got picked up by the algorithm, and it went kind of semi-viral. You can read it if you want.

This made me around $120 in that month.

Let’s look at the views for June, and they were a bit down — but still good.

This viral article helped me earn almost $500 on my own without the bonus — $490.70, which makes a total of $990.70 — so just below that $1000 mark.

I’m still gutted.

July 2021 — The Last Bonus
In July, my views went down a lot. I’ll show you.

But as previous months tell us, that’s no reason for the earnings to stay low as well.

They were alike the last month, just below $500 again. So gutted again.

I earned a total of $989.93 last month, which set an end to Mediums bonus program.

I’m looking forward to their plans of improving the Medium Partner Program in the future, and I hope to grow a lot.

Wrapping Up — What Have I Achieved
